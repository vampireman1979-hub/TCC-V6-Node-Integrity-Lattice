# TCC-V6-Node-Integrity-Lattice
The TCC V6 Node Integrity Lattice is a deterministic state‑machine that stabilizes any node into an active, aligned configuration. It offers idempotent, monotonic steps for activation, identity setting, conflict resolution, diversity expansion, and alignment updates, with fully explicit and reproducible behavior.
